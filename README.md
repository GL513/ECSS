# Nothing here yet...
### This is still in planning.
ECSS will be a high visual stimulation game with music, sound effects, and more. 
ECSS may take over 6 months before the first user-ready alpha is out. 
Once ECSS is avalible to the public, feel free to create issues for game recommendations. Also, it is appriciated if you fork this repo so I, [GL513](https://github.com/gl513) can join your repo with my own, if you are ok with it (I will create an issue about it), and build he game faster.
I am trying to remain vague for now. Nobody knows what it looks like, or any other details about the game yet.
Just letting you know, I have no programming knowledge, so this will be converted from a programming builder into a website, which will be hosted at my own github page, https://GL513.github.io/
As for the people who have even the littlest bit of knowledge, such as OKprogrammer or CyanideViper, `shut`.
Once the first alpha release is out, there should be at least one new release a month.

*this probably all sounds like trash.*
